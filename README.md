# Police Robot, Gr.12 Digital Electronics Project

This is a group project in class to restore an old bomb defusal robot frame that was donated to our school's tech department.
By restore, I mean we want to drive it around and maybe shoot nerf darts, not actually defuse bombs.

The group: Jessie (Me), Owen, Donika, Andrew.

All code by me, unless otherwise noted. Other group members are more focused on the electronics portion of the project.

## Please note: 
This repository is merely for my own organizational purposes and to get used to using Github. The code is not meant to work for any general application, and all issues and pull requests made by others will be ignored.
