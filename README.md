# Police Robot, Gr.12 Digital Electronics Project

This is a group project in class to restore an old bomb defusal robot frame that was donated to our school's tech department.
By restore, I mean we want to drive it around and maybe shoot nerf darts, not actually defuse bombs.

The group: Jessie (Me), Owen, Donika, Andrew.

All code by me, unless otherwise noted. Other group members are more focused on the electronics portion of the project.
